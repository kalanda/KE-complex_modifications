## Complex Modifications

Karabiner-Elements allows [complex modifications](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/document.html#configuration-complex-modifications): Map keys by complex rules. e.g., key to modifiers, modifiers+key to key, send key event if pressed alone, etc.

### Requirements

#### Backstick for spanish coders

Programming anguages such as Javascript or Python requires the use of the quote or backstick character (\`) which in spanish keyboards is configured as a grave accent  (àèìòù) which, by the way, is not used in spanish. Due to that, after the keystroke of the quote, we have to also press spacebar to avoid issues if the next character is a vowel. This annoyance can be resolved using this complex modification which automatically adds the spacebar after the keystroke of quote - [Import to Karabiner-Elements](karabiner://karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/import?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kalanda/KE-complex_modifications/master/rules/backstick_for_spanish_coders.json)
